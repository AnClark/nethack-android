This is a version of the NetHack port for Android that modifies some visuals
in order to be played well on e-ink screens.

Could get it to compile properly under Arch Linux 64-bit using Eclipse ADT,
Android SDK and latest Android NDK, and gets to run, but complains about
incompatibility for file "dungeon". Used assets and libnethack.so from app
distribution and works just fine!
